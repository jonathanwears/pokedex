# Pokedex created by React

## Project Description
##### This project is created by react. 
##### The id of each entry is mapped to a **useContext** provider which is provided to each component in the application. Whenever the state within the context provider updates, a large part of the application needs to update. 
##### A search box takes the input and filters the top 10 matches from the context provider. This filtered list is then used to provide a dropdown list. Selecting an entry changes the id and changes the displayed information.
